## What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)?

PWA is a term referring to **a couple of features** you can add to any web application/web page running in the browser, therefore to **enhance** it. You progressively enhance your existing web pages to make it feel and work more like native mobile apps. E.g. working when app is offline, having icon on homescreen, accessing device camera and location, synchronizing data in the background. PWAs are also supposed to works (with basic functions) on older browsers because the core thing is you **progressively** enhance a web application, which is not an all or nothing move.

1. Be reliable: load fast and provide offline functionality
2. Fast: Respond quickly to user actions
3. Engaging: Feel like a native app on mobile devices
